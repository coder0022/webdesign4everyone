<h4>BIRA</h4>

<article>Bira 91 is a craft beer brand manufactured by B9 Beverages Pvt. Ltd. It was launched in 2015. The companyâ€™s first brewery unit was located in Flanders region of Belgium where a craft distillery was used to contract manufacture the beer with ingredients from France, Belgium, Himalayas and Bavarian Farms and the beer was imported to India. After initial success, the company thereafter began manufacturing the beer in India with the same ingredients. Made from wheat, barley and hops, the beer is available in draft, 330ml, 650ml bottles and 500ml cans.[2][3] Bira raises $10 million in debt funding, to ramp up output. The company is expected to use the proceeds to ramp up its production capacity to about 1.7 million cases, up from its current 400,000 cases, sources told ET, with a significant amount also to go towards brand building.>
